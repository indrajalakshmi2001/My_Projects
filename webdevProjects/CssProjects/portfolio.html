            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Indraja lakshmi Tirumalanadhuni. During my graduation, I developed a strong interest in development. Alongside my studies, I pursued training in Python and AWS Cloud during my 5th semester at Technical Hub. Towards the end of my time at Technical Hub, I also underwent training from Tally Academy to further enhance my skills in Python and web development (HTML, CSS). During this training at Technical Hub and Tally Academy, I was placed in a job at DXC Technology on July 28th, 2022, through college placement during my 7th semester.

                At DXC Technology, I completed the first phase of training, where I learned about Cloud Computing, SQL, HTML5, CSS, Agile Testing, and Software Testing. Unfortunately, due to the recession, the company postponed the second phase of training. Nevertheless, I successfully cleared the first phase.
                
                In my final semester, I was selected for another placement after successfully passing an exam conducted by Pentagon Space during the college placement. This led to an offer of free coaching in Java Full Stack for one year. During this two-month coaching period, I studied Java, SQL, HTML and CSS,. In the second month of coaching, I received an offer from Edukemy Services Private Limited for a position in Software Testing & UX.
                
                Starting my career in the industry by transitioning into the role at Edukemy Services Private Limited as Software Testing & UX, I focus on ensuring the quality and reliability of software products. I will test the web, mobile browser, and mobile app, list the bugs in ClickUp, track them, and use SQL databases for checking values. Additionally, I will run daily standups to keep everyone updated and on track, aiming to deliver high-quality products to our stakeholders.
                
                Apart from my education and professional interests, I have a keen interest in drawing, crafts, henna art, hair styling, and fashion.I enjoy learning new things and experiencing everything at least once. Independence is something I value greatly.</p>
